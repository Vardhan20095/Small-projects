# Small-projects
These are some of my small projects I made, the links below are to my answers to questions on the website Quora, which can be used to explain my motivation for creating a solution to the questions asked:

1. Dice simulation (JAVA) : Uses basic set theory and probablity theory to simulate all the outcomes of rolling 6, 6 sided dice.
The sides can be increased and the number of dice can be too, but that would more memory. The code is in JAVA. The class is called, Lotto and has a single field: an arraylist that stores SAMPLE objects. The sample object is an inner class within Lotto that models each element of the sample space.

2. Numbers divisible: Weirdly named file in which finding the total number of numbers divisible between ZERO and any positive number (Language = C) by a BASE number. Its a small program I made that returns the total number of integers between zero and N that are divisible by Z. It does not use iteration directly but my own method:
